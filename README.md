This project is currently **still in development**!

# Notes

1. This only works on linux machines, and they must be debian based (Ex: Ubuntu.)

# .env

1. Make a `.env` file.
2. add `DISCORDCLIENTID` and `DISCORDCLIENTTOKEN` in the `.env` file. Should look like this:

```
DISCORDCLIENTID=IDHERE
DISCORDCLIENTTOKEN=TOKENHERE
```
